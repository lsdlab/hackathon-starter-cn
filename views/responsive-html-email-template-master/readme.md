## Sending emails using a marketing service like Campaign Monitor or Mailchimp?

Use the template as is. They'll put the CSS inline for you when you put together your campaign.


## Sending emails directly from your app or using a developer service

For an API like [Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com)  you need to put the CSS inline. You can use [Premailer](http://premailer.dialect.ca/) to do this automatically.

* Copy all of email.html
* Paste the HTML as the source into Premailer
* Copy the HTML results and use them in your email view/template

Note that some services may allow you to opt into CSS inlining, such as
[Mandrill](http://help.mandrill.com/entries/24460141-Does-Mandrill-inline-CSS-automatically-).

## Tried and tested on all major email clients

Tested on mobile, desktop and web.
